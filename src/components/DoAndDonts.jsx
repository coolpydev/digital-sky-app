            <h2>Do & Don’ts regarding operations of RPAS</h2>

            <p>Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)/ Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS),
                commonly known as drones/ UAV, is a new addition to the aviation sector. This
                technology has promising effect on economic growth of India; both manufacturing
                and service industry.</p>

            <p>As more people enter the commercial and recreational hobby RPA scene; the
                prospects for RPA accidents/ incidents also multiply. This applies not just to
                newcomers/ amateurs but even to professionals.</p>

            <p>Here are some operational safety tips to ensure that you have a better and
                safer flying experience, not just for yourself but the people around you.</p>

            <h2>Do’s</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure your RPA (except Nano in uncontrolled airspace upto 50ft) is
                    Digital Sky “No Permission- No Take off” (NPNT) Compliant</li>
                <li>Obtain Unique Identification Number (UIN) from DGCA for operating in
                    controlled airspace and affix it on your RPA</li>
                <li>Obtain Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP), if applicable from DGCA for
                    commercial operations and keep it handy</li>
                <li>Obtain Permission before each flight through Digital Sky Platform</li>
                <li>Ensure RPA is in good condition (not damaged) and fit for flying safely.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on interference: Interference can be from mobile devices or
                    blockage of signals, do watch out when flying your RPA.</li>
                <li>Fly only during daylight (after sunrise to before sunset)</li>
                <li>Fly in good weather: Good weather lets you not only fly your RPA better
                    but also keep track of it in the air.</li>
                <li>Fly in visual line of sight (VLOS): Always be within visual range of your RPA.</li>
                <li>Follow Flying Guidelines</li>
                <li>Do your homework before spending the considerable money for a RPA. Make
                    sure you clearly understand all operational and regulatory aspects.</li>
                <li>Be aware of Airspace Restrictions/ No RPA Zones</li>
                <li>Do stay away from airports and heliports</li>
                <li>Respect privacy of people
                </li>

                <li>Keep local police informed about your RPA flying activity. If you are ever
                    approached by police provide all requisite information.</li>
                <li>Do log your flights and intimate concerned authorities (like DGCA, local
                    police etc.) of any incidents/ accidents</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Don’ts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t fly a Nano RPA above 50ft (15m) from the ground level</li>
                <li>Don’t fly a Micro RPA above 200ft (60m) from the ground level</li>
                <li>Don’t fly RPA more than 400ft (120m) from the ground level</li>
                <li>Don’t fly RPA near other aircraft (manned or unmanned)</li>
